#  BMI Calculator

Based on the userâ€™s weight and height this app will calculate their body mass with differing pieces of advice depening on their BMI. Through this app I pracied using optionals and classes while implmenting the MVC design pattern.

## What I learned

* How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
* How to create classes and difference between classes and structs. 
* Pass by value vs. pass by reference. 
* Formatting Strings. 
* Color literals.

Developed by using logic learned from a course by the London App Brewery
